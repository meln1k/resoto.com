We were building a product that did much more than just \\"housekeeping for your clouds.\\"\\n\\nWe partnered with brand namer [Steve Cecil](http://wherewords.com) to devise a new name. I found the process to be really special and quite fun, though [Steve](http://wherewords.com) did require us to invest quite a bit of our time.\\n\\nThe process began with each member of the \\"naming committee\\" individually completing a sixty-question questionnaire exploring different facets of our product and brand identity. \ud83d\udcdd\\n\\nWe then met for a two-hour working session, during which we were assigned homework: to review 264 potential product names born from [Steve](http://wherewords.com)\'s genius, reading and re-reading them both front-to-back and back-to-front, and (again, individually) submit a ranked list of our favorites.\\n\\nAll the work [Steve](http://wherewords.com) asked of us paid off, and we ended the second working session with our new name: **_Resoto_**. \u2728\\n\\nSince you\'ve found your way here, you presumably have also noticed that we have a new website to accompany the rebranded project!\\n\\nI joined the team as a [technical writer](https://github.com/lloesche/valheim-server-docker/issues/423) (no, your eyes are not deceiving you\u2014I was discovered on [GitHub](https://github.com) as a result of my open-source contributions!) and joined the [Some Engineering](https://some.engineering) team to find a somewhat broken documentation system and pipeline.\\n\\nDocumentation was formatted using [reStructredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html), and [Lukas](https://github.com/lloesche) told me that he \\"\\\\[hated\\\\] editing [reStructredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) in [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), so \\\\[he doesn\'t\\\\] do it.\\" \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n**You know that there is a serious problem when the developers on your team don\'t want to write documentation simply because it is too painful to do so.**\\n\\n[Lukas](https://github.com/lloesche) suggested migrating our documentation to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). As I began poking around and reading the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs), it quickly became apparent that [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) could do _much more_ than just docs! \ud83e\udd96\\n\\nWe originally intended to partner with a design firm to create a design for the Resoto website, which would also serve as the new, more appropriate home for our documentation. However, I couldn\'t ship `resoto.com/docs` without `resoto.com`, so I found myself blocked.\\n\\nBeing a generally grumpy person when I do not have something concrete to show for my time and effort (and, perhaps also somewhat importantly, possessing some web design and frontend development experience)\u2026 I decided to take matters into my own hands.\\n\\nAnd now, you\'re looking at the result! I can attest to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) being very easy to set up and work with, especially if you have experience with [React](https://reactjs.org). \u269b\ufe0f\\n\\nP.S.: If you are also head-over-heels in love with our sheep logo and mascot, it was created in-house by our insanely talented designer [Raffaele](https://github.com/RPicster). Please be on the lookout for a future blog post about the design process. \ud83c\udfa8"}]}')}}]);
